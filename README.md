# Password-Generator

## Application Overview

Having a strong password is invaluable to anyone using the internet, but coming up with original passwords can be difficult, not to mention tedious if a user is trying not to recycle passwords for different websites and application subscriptions. The strongest passwords are alphanumeric, containing both uppercase and lowercase characters, as well as special characters.

The Password-Generator app aids users with the creation of a strong password using random character generation, following a series of user prompts. The user can set the desired length of their password (between 8 characters and 128 characters), and choose whether or not the password contains lowercase characters, uppercase characters and/or special characters. If the password length chosen is outside of the length criteria, the user will be prompted to enter a valid number. Likewise, if the user does not choose to include any of the character arrays, they will be alerted that they must choose at least one additional criteria, besides valid password length, in order to continue with password generation. After the user has finished selecting their criteria, they will have an opportunity to review and confirm their choices prior to receiving their password. If they are not satisfied, the page will be reset and they may change their criteria.

A reset button has been added so that multiple random passwords may be generated, if desired.
